We have implemented a "use" command. The player is able to use an item at certain locations to gain points or unlock
other items. This goes beyond the baseline requirements because it provides additional text enriching the gameplay of
the text adventure and allowing another method of obtaining points. It also allows for items to be shown that could not
be initially done at the start of the game, the player would have to have done something to access those items.
