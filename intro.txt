You've got an important exam coming up this evening, and you've been studying for weeks. Last night was a particularly
late night on campus. You had difficulty focusing, so rather than staying in one place, you studied in various places
throughout the building as the night progressed. Unfortunately, when you woke up this morning, you were missing some
important exam-related items. You cannot find your T-card, and you're pretty sure that you're not going to get into
tonight's exam without it. Also, you seem to have misplaced your lucky exam pen -- even if they let you in, you can't
possibly write with another pen! Finally, your instructor for the course is nicer than your CSC108 instructors in that
they are allowing you one handwritten page of information in the exam. Last night, you painstakingly crammed as much
material onto a single page as humanly possible, but that's missing, too! All of this stuff must be around the building
somewhere! Can you find all of it before your exam starts tonight?

You awake on the floor of your room, still feeling the searing headache from last night's 'study session'. You really
aren't feeling up to writing an exam, but on the other hand you would like to pass this class. Whether you like it or
not, you get your lazy ass up and proceed downstairs to try and find your things.
